1. Listing files ---
--------------------
$ ls -Fal. --> F - for non color display, a - show hidden, l - long listing
$ ls -FaRl --> R - Recursive

$ ls M*
$ ls M?sic
$ ls M[ur]sic
$ ls M[a-z]sic


inode number - Unique number assigned by the os to all the files in the virtual file system
$ ls -i --> i - inode number


2. Copying files ---
--------------------
cp source destination
The new file acts like a brand new file with updated modification time.

$ cp -iR src dst --> i - ask whether to overwrite a file

3. Linking files ---
--------------------
Symbolic link
Hard link

Symbolic link ---
$ ln -s original_file s_link_file
inode number is different from the orginal file. New file is created that points to the original file.

Hard link --
$ ln orginal_file h_link_file
inode number is the same as the original file. However they are physically the same file.
